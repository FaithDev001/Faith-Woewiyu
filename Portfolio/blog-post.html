                    When I first started Android development, I was both excited and nervous. I had learned some
                    basic Java and Kotlin, but building a full app felt like a huge task. I started small - creating a 
                    simple "Expense Tracker App" that allowed users to add daily expenses and view a running total.

                <p>
                    The biggest challenge I faced was managing local storage and making sure the data save correctly.
                    I learned now to used <strong>Room Database</strong> and Android's <strong>ViewMode1</strong> to handle data efficiently.
                    Once I got that right, everything else started to clicks.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Later, I added a feature that let users filter expenses by data and category. Seeing the app work
                    smoothly for the first time was one of the best feelings ever - and it confirmed my passion for 
                    Android development.

                    My advice for beginners? Don't rush. Start with small, real-world projects. Focus on learning 
                    how everything connects - that's where the real growth happens.
                </P>
